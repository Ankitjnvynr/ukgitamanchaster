The Manchester Gita Festival 2025

The Manchester Gita Festival 2025, taking place from 20th to 22nd June 2025, will be a three-day celebration of Yoga in its true essence, exploring its diverse forms and deeper philosophical significance. Rooted in the teachings of the Bhagwad Gita, the festival will highlight Yoga as a profound path to self-realisation, inner transformation, and unity.

At its core, Yoga is not merely physical exercise but a way of life, originating from the ancient wisdom of India. The true form of Yoga, as outlined in the Bhagwad Gita, encompasses discipline of the body, mind, and soul, guiding individuals towards inner peace, self-awareness, and ultimate liberation (moksha). It is a practice of union—with oneself, with others, and with the divine.

A key focus of the festival is International Yoga Day on 21st June, a globally recognised occasion that signifies Yoga’s universal relevance and timeless wisdom. This day, established by the United Nations in 2014, acknowledges Yoga’s contribution to holistic well-being, spiritual harmony, and the unity of humanity. The festival will reaffirm the true essence of Yoga—not merely as postures and breathing techniques but as a comprehensive philosophy of life, as revealed in the Bhagwad Gita.

At its heart, the Manchester Gita Festival embodies the motto: Peace, Love, and Harmony. Through the practice and philosophy of Yoga, the festival aims to foster inner peace, universal love, and social harmony, bringing together people from all walks of life, cultures, and backgrounds. It is a celebration of diversity and unity, reinforcing how Yoga transcends barriers, creating a shared space of connection and understanding.

Inclusivity & Community Participation

The festival will welcome all Yoga studios, instructors, and schools, inviting them to participate and contribute to this celebration of Yoga. Each will be given a dedicated stand to showcase their Yoga school or studio, allowing attendees to connect with different traditions and styles of Yoga.
